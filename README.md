#### By _**Jessica Hvozdovich**_

## Description

_This webpage allows a user to enter the sides of a triangle and will return the type of triangle they have created. The exercise is meant to practice using npm, separating business logic into separate js files, and bundling logic while retaining functionality. There is additional focus on Behavior Driven Development, testing with Jest, and the Red Green Refactor strategy._
